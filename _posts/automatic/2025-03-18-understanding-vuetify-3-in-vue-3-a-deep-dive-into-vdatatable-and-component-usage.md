## Introduction

As developers venture into the world of Vue 3 and Vuetify 3, they encounter a unique set of features and conventions that distinguish this version from its predecessor, Vuetify 2. This post aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of using **VDataTable**, exploring the differences between PascalCase and kebab-case conventions and highlighting essential registration steps. 

## VDataTable vs v-data-table: Understanding the Difference

In Vuetify 3.x, naming conventions have evolved. As a developer, you can utilize either the **PascalCase** or the **kebab-case** syntax, but it's crucial to ensure proper component importation.

### PascalCase (VDataTable)

The **PascalCase** format is used during the import of Vuetify components. This makes it clear which components are explicitly imported and used, allowing for better manageability within your code. 

Example:
```javascript
import { VDataTable } from 'vuetify';
```

### kebab-case (v-data-table)

On the other hand, when utilizing components in your Vue template, you typically follow the kebab-case convention. This is because HTML tags are naturally written in kebab-case, which aligns with Vueâ€™s component rendering conventions.

Example:
```vue
<v-data-table></v-data-table>
```

By adhering to these conventions, you not only maintain clarity in your code but also ensure a smooth workflow when dealing with components in your project.

## The Importance of app.use(vuetify)

One critical step when working with Vuetify in your Vue 3 application is registering Vuetify as a plugin. You achieve this by calling `app.use(vuetify)`. Without this registration, Vue will not recognize your Vuetify components, even if you have imported them correctly.

### Example of Using Vuetify Components in Vue 3

#### Step 1: Install Vuetify

Start by installing Vuetify in your project with the following command:

```bash
npm install vuetify@next
```

#### Step 2: Register Vuetify in main.js or main.ts

Next, in your main entry point (commonly `main.js` or `main.ts`), you need to register Vuetify by adding:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify';  // Import Vuetify
import 'vuetify/styles';  // Import Vuetify styles

const vuetify = createVuetify();  // Create Vuetify plugin

createApp(App)
  .use(vuetify)  // Register Vuetify plugin
  .mount('#app');
```

#### Step 3: Use Vuetify Components in App.vue

Now that Vuetify is registered, you can incorporate Vuetify components, such as **VDataTable**, in your Vue component:

```vue
<template>
  <v-container>
    <v-data-table :items="items" :headers="headers"></v-data-table>
  </v-container>
</template>

<script>
import { VDataTable } from 'vuetify';  // Import the Vuetify component

export default {
  components: {
    VDataTable,  // Register in components
  },
  data() {
    return {
      headers: [
        { text: 'Name', value: 'name' },
        { text: 'Age', value: 'age' },
      ],
      items: [
        { name: 'John', age: 30 },
        { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
      ],
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

### Example of Using v-data-table (kebab-case)

If you prefer using the kebab-case naming convention, ensure Vuetify is correctly registered. You can use the component directly in your template without explicit imports:

```vue
<template>
  <v-container>
    <v-data-table :items="items" :headers="headers"></v-data-table>
  </v-container>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      headers: [
        { text: 'Name', value: 'name' },
        { text: 'Age', value: 'age' },
      ],
      items: [
        { name: 'John', age: 30 },
        { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
      ],
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

## Conclusion

In summary, understanding the distinction between **VDataTable** and **v-data-table** is crucial when working with Vuetify 3 in Vue 3. The **PascalCase** format is preferred for imports, while **kebab-case** is used within templates. Always remember to register Vuetify correctly using `app.use(vuetify)` to make your components globally available. 

By following these guidelines, you will streamline your development process with Vuetify and create a more efficient and manageable codebase. Happy coding!

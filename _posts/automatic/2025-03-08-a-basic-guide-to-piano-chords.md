# Understanding Basic Piano Chords

Chords on a piano are a combination of several notes played simultaneously. These notes originate from a specific scale and are arranged in a certain order. A chord is usually formed from at least three notes. 

## The Structure of a C Major Chord

To understand this better, let's take a look at the construction of a very common chord, the C Major chord.

A Major chord is always composed of three principal notes:

1. The root note (in this case, 'C')
2. The Major third (four half-steps above the root – in this case, 'E')
3. The perfect fifth (seven half-steps above the root – in this case, 'G')

When playing the C Major chord on the piano, you simultaneously press the keys C, E, and G.

## Major and Minor Chords

However, chords aren't limited to Major chords; there are also minor chords. Minor chords consist of three notes, similar to Major chords. However, the third is a minor third, meaning it's only three half-steps above the root note. 

Consider the C minor chord, which consists of the notes 'C', 'Eb', and 'G'. Here, the third (from 'C' to 'Eb') is a minor third, not a major third like in the case of the C Major chord. 

To summarize: 

- C Major: C (Root) – E (Major third) – G (Perfect fifth)
- C minor: C (Root) – Eb (Minor third) – G (Perfect fifth)

## Other Chords

There are many additional chords such as D Major, F Major, and A minor. The structure remains similar; it's just the notes that change depending on the key you're using. 

For instance: 

- A D Major chord is formed by the notes 'D', 'F#', and 'A'.
- An A minor chord is formed by the notes 'A', 'C', and 'E'.

## The Importance of Chords

Chords are the foundation of almost all pieces of music played on the piano. Understanding the various chords and their structures can enable you to play many songs and even compose your own music!

That's a basic overview of piano chords. With this foundation, you're equipped to explore chords further and, in doing so, expand your dynamic range of musical knowledge and capabilities.

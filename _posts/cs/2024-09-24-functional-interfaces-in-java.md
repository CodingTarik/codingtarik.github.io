In Java, interfaces that contain only a single method are called **"Functional Interfaces."** These are designed to serve as the **target for lambda expressions** or method references.

A **Functional Interface** has exactly one abstract method, although it may include default or static methods. One of the most well-known examples is the `java.lang.Runnable` interface, which defines only the `run()` method.

Since Java 8, the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation can be used to explicitly mark an interface as functional. While this annotation is optional, it helps the compiler ensure that the interface contains only one abstract method.

### Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void doSomething();
}
```

### Common Functional Interfaces in Java:
- `java.util.function.Consumer<T>` (takes one argument and returns nothing)
- `java.util.function.Function<T, R>` (takes one argument and returns a result)
- `java.util.function.Predicate<T>` (takes one argument and returns a boolean)

With the introduction of Functional Interfaces in Java 8, lambda expressions and method references became possible, allowing for more concise and readable code.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use a **Functional Interface** with a **lambda expression** in Java. This example demonstrates a simple use case where we define and use a functional interface.

### Example of a Functional Interface with Lambda Expression

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello(String name);
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using a lambda expression to implement the Functional Interface
        Greeting greeting = (name) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        
        // Invoking the method defined in the functional interface
        greeting.sayHello("Alice");
        greeting.sayHello("Bob");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Functional Interface**: The `Greeting` interface is a functional interface because it contains only one abstract method, `sayHello(String name)`. The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation ensures that the interface conforms to the definition of a functional interface.

2. **Lambda Expression**: In the `main` method, a lambda expression `(name) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!")` is used to provide an implementation of the `sayHello` method.

3. **Calling the Lambda**: Once we assign the lambda to a variable of type `Greeting`, we can use it like any other method. Here, `greeting.sayHello("Alice")` calls the lambda expression and prints "Hello, Alice!".

### Output:
```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
```

This example shows how functional interfaces in Java, combined with lambda expressions, can simplify code and make it more readable and expressive.

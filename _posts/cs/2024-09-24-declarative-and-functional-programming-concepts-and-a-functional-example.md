### Declarative and Functional Programming: Concepts and a Functional Example

In the world of software development, programming paradigms shape the way we think about solving problems. Two paradigms that often come up in discussions are **declarative programming** and **functional programming**. In this blog post, we'll explore both concepts and how they relate to each other. We'll also look at an example written in a purely functional programming language.

### What is Declarative Programming?

**Declarative programming** is a style of programming where you describe **what** you want to accomplish rather than **how** to accomplish it. This contrasts with **imperative programming**, where you provide step-by-step instructions on how to achieve the desired outcome.

Key characteristics of declarative programming:
- You focus on **outcome** rather than on the detailed procedure.
- The underlying system or language handles the "how" behind the scenes.
  
Declarative programming languages and paradigms include:
- **SQL**: You describe what data you want (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users`), but not how the database should retrieve it.
- **HTML**: You define how content should be structured and displayed without specifying how the browser should render the page.
- **Functional Programming (FP)** is considered a declarative paradigm because it emphasizes describing **what** needs to be computed rather than manipulating state and providing explicit control flow.

### What is Functional Programming?

**Functional programming** is a form of declarative programming that treats computation as the evaluation of **mathematical functions**. It avoids mutable state and focuses on the use of pure functions, higher-order functions, and first-class functions.

Key characteristics of functional programming:
1. **Pure Functions**: A pure function's output depends only on its input, and it has no side effects (i.e., it doesn't modify any external state).
   
2. **Immutability**: Once data is created, it cannot be modified. This eliminates issues related to state changes and side effects.
   
3. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned as values, and stored in data structures. Higher-order functions take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
   
4. **Function Composition**: Functional programming encourages the composition of simple functions to build more complex operations.

Languages like **Haskell**, **Lisp**, and **Scala** support functional programming paradigms strongly, but other languages, such as **JavaScript** and **Python**, also support functional constructs.

### What is Java?

**Java** is primarily an **object-oriented programming language**. Released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), Java is platform-independent, designed to run on multiple platforms via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While Java's core is object-oriented, since Java 8, it has incorporated functional programming features like **lambda expressions**, **streams**, and **functional interfaces**.

Java allows developers to write both object-oriented and functional code, giving it a hybrid approach in modern versions.

### Example of a Functional Program in Haskell

Now that we've explored the theory behind functional programming, let's look at a real-world example written in a functional language—**Haskell**. Haskell is a purely functional programming language, meaning everything is expressed in terms of functions.

In this example, we’ll work with a list of numbers, filter for even numbers, and double each even number. This is a functional approach using higher-order functions and immutability.

```haskell
-- A function to double even numbers in a list
doubleEvens :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleEvens xs = map (*2) (filter even xs)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    let result = doubleEvens numbers
    print result
```

### Explanation:

1. **Pure Function (`doubleEvens`)**: The function `doubleEvens` takes a list of integers (`[Int]`) as input and returns a new list of integers. It filters the even numbers using the `filter` function and then uses the `map` function to double each even number. Both `filter` and `map` are **higher-order functions**.
   
2. **Immutability**: The list `numbers` is not modified in place. Instead, a new list is created as the result of the filtering and mapping operations. This is characteristic of functional programming, where data is immutable.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**: `map` and `filter` are higher-order functions. `filter` takes a predicate function (`even`) and applies it to each element of the list, returning only the elements that satisfy the condition. `map` takes a function (`(*2)`, which multiplies each number by 2) and applies it to each element of the filtered list.

4. **First-Class Functions**: Functions like `even` and `(*2)` are passed as arguments to higher-order functions, demonstrating that functions are first-class citizens in Haskell.

### Output:

```
[4, 8, 12]
```

The result of running this Haskell program is `[4, 8, 12]`, showing that it successfully filtered out the even numbers and doubled them.

### Functional Programming in Real-World Applications

Functional programming has grown in popularity in recent years, especially in areas where concurrency, immutability, and clear logic flow are important. Industries like **finance**, **web development**, and **data science** use functional languages like Haskell, Scala, or functional programming features in languages like JavaScript and Python for various tasks, such as:
- **Concurrency**: Functional programming avoids mutable state, making it easier to reason about and implement concurrent or parallel algorithms.
- **Data transformation**: With immutable data structures and functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, transforming data collections is straightforward and error-free.
- **Predictability**: Since functions are pure, they are predictable and testable. This leads to more reliable and bug-resistant code.

### Conclusion

**Declarative programming** emphasizes describing **what** the program should achieve rather than **how** to achieve it. **Functional programming**, as a subset of declarative programming, focuses on using pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions to express logic.

While **Java** is mainly object-oriented, it has evolved to incorporate functional programming features, making it a versatile language. However, in purely functional languages like **Haskell**, the benefits of functional programming—such as immutability, first-class functions, and higher-order functions—are fully realized, leading to concise and robust code.

Understanding and adopting functional programming techniques can help developers write more maintainable, testable, and scalable software, whether in Java, Haskell, or another language with functional capabilities.
